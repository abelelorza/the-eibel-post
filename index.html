            President Donald Trump spent his first night at Walter Reed Military Medical 
            Center after he and first lady Melania Trump tested positive for COVID-19.
            His positive test came hours after Hope Hicks, a White House aide with whom 
            Trump had recently traveled, had also tested positive.</p>

            Trump was taken by helicopter to the hospital outside Washington, after he started
            showing symptoms. Melania Trump did not join the president for the hospital stay.
            Vice President Mike Pence and his wife Karen tested negative for the virus Friday
            morning, his press secretary Devin Oâ€™Malley tweeted.  Including Hicks, at least 10
            other people in close contact with Trump have tested positive for COVID-19.</p>
            
        <p>   Ivanka Trump and her husband, Trump senior advisor Jared Kushner, tested
            negative, according to a tweet from Special Assistant to the President Carolina
            Hurley. The Trumps' 14-year-old son Barron also tested negative, White House
            spokeswoman Stephanie Grisham told USA TODAY.</p>
